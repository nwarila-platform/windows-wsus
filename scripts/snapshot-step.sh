# --- [ Description ] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Rolling per-step snapshot (Director, 2026-07-16): captures the VM's CURRENT state as the
# pre-change point for the NEXT piece, so its proof runs revert here (fast no-op of all
# merged pieces) instead of re-converging from the fresh-OS baseline every time.
#
#   Usage: scripts/snapshot-step.sh <next-piece-id>        e.g. snapshot-step.sh C06d
#
# Contract (docs/VM-LIFECYCLE.md §4):
#   - Take ONLY from a VERIFIED, MERGED post-piece state — never mid-proof, never from a
#     failed/dirty run. The baseline remains the only fresh-OS anchor and is NEVER touched.
#   - Exactly ONE rolling snapshot exists: any previous 'pre-*' step snapshot is deleted
#     first (VMware duplicates chain entries on same-name snapshots; count stays <= 2).
#   - Taken RUNNING with memory (revert resumes in seconds, no boot wait).
