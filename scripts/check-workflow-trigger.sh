# check-workflow-trigger.sh — assert this repo's aws-deploy.yml trigger matches the org contract
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Three sibling repositories must share ONE trigger behaviour for their AWS deploy workflow. They
# drifted within an hour of the second one being written, and the drift was invisible on reading:
# one repo DECLARED `types:` while another OMITTED the key entirely. Omitting it looks like less
# configuration but means "inherit GitHub's default", which includes `synchronize` — so the two
# files behaved differently while appearing merely differently verbose.
#
# That is the same failure as two IAM defects found the same day: the semantics of an ABSENT key.
# A condition with `...IfExists` passes when the key is absent; a condition on a key invalid for a
# resource type fails when absent; an absent `types:` silently changes which events fire. Reading
# does not catch this class. Only an assertion does.
#
# The IAM sources have such an assertion and consequently never drifted. This is the equivalent
# for the workflow trigger.
#
#   ./scripts/check-workflow-trigger.sh
#
# Exit 0 = the trigger matches the contract.
