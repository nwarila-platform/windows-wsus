# --- [ Description ] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Composition runner: builds the combined execution tree and runs the playbook.
#
#   1. Clones/updates nwarila-platform/ansible-framework into .compose/ansible-framework
#      and checks out the commit pinned in .framework-pin (tags once upstream releases).
#   2. Overlays this repo's roles into the framework's applications/ namespace (rsync
#      --delete so stale files never linger).
#   3. Runs the selected playbook with the framework's ansible.cfg as the chassis
#      (its roles_path resolves roles by bare name).
#
# Usage: scripts/compose-and-run.sh [-e env=int] [any extra ansible-playbook args...]
#        COMPOSE_PLAYBOOK=<name>.yml to select a playbook under ansible/playbooks/ (default wsus.yml).
#        SKIP_REVERT=1 to bypass the snapshot-revert gate (composition testing only).
#        REVERT_TO=pre-<piece> to revert to the rolling per-step snapshot instead of
#        the fresh-OS baseline (passed through to revert-vm.sh; VM-LIFECYCLE.md §2).
