# check-iam-literals.sh — the substitution gate for docs/reference/aws-iam/
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The AWS IAM pattern in this repo was cloned from a sibling. Four independent audit rounds
# (see the working notes) found that the dangerous clone failure is NOT a total
# substitution miss — that fails closed and loudly. It is a PARTIAL miss: a foreign repository
# identity or state prefix left behind in one statement, which silently grants this repo
# authority over a SIBLING's live resources in the shared AWS account, while this repo's own
# deploy still works. Reading an applied policy back and diffing it against the materialized
# source cannot catch that, because the materialized source is what is wrong.
#
# This gate is the mechanical answer. It has two modes.
#
#   repo mode (default)     Run against the tracked sources. Placeholders MUST be present and
#                           foreign literals MUST NOT be. This is the CI gate.
#
#   materialized mode       Run against an untracked, substituted directory just before any
#                           `aws iam` call. NO placeholder may remain.
#                             ./scripts/check-iam-literals.sh --materialized <dir>
#
# Exit 0 = safe to proceed. Any other exit = do not apply.
