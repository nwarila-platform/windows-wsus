#
# Reverts the dev VM to a clean snapshot and waits for SSH to answer.
# DISCIPLINE: run this before EVERY playbook execution — never deploy onto a dirty VM.
# Default target is the fresh-OS baseline. Per-step discipline (Director, 2026-07-16):
# REVERT_TO=pre-<piece> reverts to the rolling pre-change snapshot instead (taken by
# scripts/snapshot-step.sh from the previous piece's verified, merged state) — prior
# pieces then no-op fast instead of re-converging from scratch. The target must EXIST;
# a typo fails loud here rather than silently reverting somewhere unexpected.
# Snapshots are taken RUNNING (memory included), so revert resumes the guest almost
# instantly; 'vmrun start' is issued defensively for the powered-off case.
